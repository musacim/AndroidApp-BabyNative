    '''In traditional grammar, word is the basic unit of language. Words can be classified according to their action and meaning, but it is challenging to define. 

A word refers to a speech sound, or a mixture of two or more speech sounds in both written and verbal form of language. A word works as a symbol to represent/refer to something/someone in language to communicate a specific meaning.
Example : ‘love’, ‘cricket’, ‘sky’ etc.

"[A word is the] smallest unit of grammar that can stand alone as a complete utterance, separated by spaces in written language and potentially by pauses in speech."

Morphology, a branch of linguistics, studies the formation of words. The branch of linguistics that studies the meaning of words is called lexical semantics.
There are several criteria for a speech sound, or a combination of some speech sounds to be called a word.

There must be a potential pause in speech and a space in written form between two words.
For instance, suppose ‘ball’ and ‘bat’ are two different words. So, if we use them in a sentence, we must have a potential pause after pronouncing each of them. It cannot be like “Idonotplaywithbatball.” If we take pause, these sounds can be regarded as seven distinct words which are ‘I,' ‘do,' ‘not,' ‘play,' ‘with,' ‘bat,' and ‘ball.'
Every word must contain at least one root. If you break this root, it cannot be a word anymore.
For example, the word ‘unfaithful’ has a root ‘faith.' If we break ‘faith’ into ‘fa’ and ‘ith,' these sounds will not be regarded as words.
Every word must have a meaning.
For example, the sound ‘lakkanah’ has no meaning in the English language. So, it cannot be an English word.

final grammer2 =
    '''A sentence is the largest unit of any language. In English, it begins with a capital letter and ends with a full-stop, or a question mark, or an exclamation mark.The sentence is generally defined as a word or a group of words that expresses a thorough idea by giving a statement/order, or asking a question, or exclaiming.

Example:
He is a good boy (statement), Is he a good boy? (question), What a nice weather! (exclaiming).

Ideally, a sentence requires at least one subject and one verb. Sometimes the subject of a sentence can be hidden, but the verb must be visible and present in the sentence. Verb is called the heart of a sentence.  

Example:
Do it. (In this sentence, a subject ‘you’ is hidden but verb ‘do’ is visible)   

“[A sentence is] a group of words, usually containing a verb, that expresses a thought in the form of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and starts with a capital letter when written.”  

In other words, a complete English sentence must have three characteristics:

First, in written form, a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period (i.e., a full stop) [.], a note of interrogation (i.e., a question mark) [?], or a note of exclamation (i.e., an exclamation mark) [!].
Second, it must express a complete thought, not fragmented.  
Third, it must contain at least one subject (hidden/visible) and one verb comprising an independent clause. (An independent clause contains an independent subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.)


Types of Sentences
Structurally, sentences are of four types:
1-Simple sentence
2-Compound sentence
3-Complex sentence, and 
4-Compound-complex sentence.


1-Simple sentence

A simple sentence must have a single clause (a single verb) which is independent, and it cannot take another clause.
Example:
I always wanted to become a writer. (One clause – one verb)

2-Compound sentence

A compound sentence must have more than one independent clause with no dependent clauses. Some specific conjunctions, punctuation, or both are used to join together these clauses.
Example:
I always wanted to become a writer, and she wanted to become a doctor. (Two independent clauses – two verbs)

3-Complex sentence

A complex sentence also has more than one clause but of one them must be an independent clause and the other/others must be (a) dependent clause(es). There are also some particular connectors for the clauses of a complex sentence to be connected.
Example:
I know that you always wanted to be a writer. (Here, a dependent clause is followed by a connector and an independent clause. The other way around is also possible.)

4-Compound-complex sentence

A compound-complex sentence (or complex–compound sentence) is a mixture of the features of compound and complex sentences in one sentence. So, it must contain at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.
Example:
I know that you always wanted to become a writer, but I always wanted to become a doctor. (Here, one dependent clause is followed by a complex connector and two independent clauses with a compound conjunction between them.)  

 

Functionally, sentences are of mainly four types:
1-Declarative sentence
2-Imperative sentence
3-Interrogative sentence, and
4-Exclamatory sentence

1-An assertive sentence (declarative sentence):
 Simply expresses an opinion/feeling, or makes a statement, or describes things. In other words, it declares something. This type of sentence ends with a period (i.e., a full-stop).

Examples:
I want to be a good cricketer. (a statement)
I am very happy today. (a feeling)

2-Imperative sentence:
We use an imperative sentence to make a request or to give a command. Imperative sentences usually end with a period (i.e., a full stop), but under certain circumstances, it can end with a note of exclamation (i.e., exclamation mark).

Examples:
Please sit down.
I need you to sit down now!


3-Interrogative sentence:
An interrogative sentence asks a question. Interrogative sentences must end with a note of interrogation (i.e., question mark)

Examples:
When are you going to submit your assignment?
Do you know him?


4-Exclamatory sentence.

An exclamatory sentence expresses overflow of emotions. These emotions can be of happiness, wonder, sorrow, anger, etc. 

Examples:
What a day it was!
I cannot believe he would do that!

final grammer3 = '''
Parts of speech are the classification of words categorized by their roles and functions within the structure of the language.  
Parts of speech encompass everything a language has in itself. Can you imagine all the words of a language can be sorted into these categories? They play different roles in the structure of a language.
In English, there are eight parts of speech: 

1-Noun
2-Pronoun
3-Verb
4-Adjective
5-Adverb
6-Preposition
7-Conjunction
8-Interjection
All of these topics are explanied with details in main menu, but lets explain briefly for now; 

1-Noun
Noun refers to people, places, things, ideas, concepts, etc.
Example: “Michael” is a good boy.  “Melbourne” is the best “city”.

2-Pronoun
A pronoun is used to refer to a noun/noun phrase, or nouns/noun phrases; instead of the repeated use of the same noun(s)/noun phrase(s).
Example: Michael is a good boy. “He” gets up early in the morning.

3-Verb
Verb shows an action or an ongoing condition. It is considered as the heart of a sentence.
Example: Alex “is going” home. He “loves” his home.

4-Adjective
Adjective modifies or describes noun in a sentence.
Example: Alex loves his “beautiful” daughters. His daughters also love their “caring” father. 

5-Adverb
Adverbs modify or describe adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs. It answers the questions When? Where? How? or How much?
Example: He is running “fast”.  She “always” reads “attentively”. 

6-Preposition
Preposition gives context to nouns in relationship to other nouns or pronouns.
Example: I am going “to” France. France is “in” Europe.

7-Conjunction
A conjunction connects nouns, noun phrases, clauses or sentences together.
Example: Julie love chocolate “and” chips. She loves pasta, “but” she hates pizza.

8-Interjection
Interjections are brief and abrupt pauses in speech, usually used for expressing emotions.
Example: “Oh!” That feels terrible. “Alas!” They have lost the match.

''';

final grammer4 =
    '''Nouns refer to persons, animals, places, things, ideas, or events, etc. Nouns encompass most of the words of a language.

Noun can be a/an -  

Person – a name for a person: - Max, Julie, Catherine, Michel, Bob, etc.
Animal – a name for an animal: - dog, cat, cow, kangaroo, etc.
Place – a name for a place: - London, Australia, Canada, Mumbai, etc.
Thing – a name for a thing: - bat, ball, chair, door, house, computer, etc.
Idea – A name for an idea: - devotion, superstition, happiness, excitement, etc.

Different Types of Noun:
1-Proper Noun
2-Common Noun
3-Abstract Noun
4-Concrete Noun
5-Countable Noun
6-Non-countable Noun
7-Collective Noun
8-Compound Noun
9-Proper Noun:

1-A proper noun is a name which refers only to a single person, place, or thing and there is no common name for it. In written English, a proper noun always begins with capital letters.
Example: 
Melbourne (it refers to only one particular city), Steve (refers to a particular person),
Australia (there is no other country named Australia; this name is fixed for only one country).
 
2-Common Noun:
A common noun is a name for something which is common for many things, person, or places. It encompasses a particular type of things, person, or places.
Example: Country (it can refer to any country, nothing in particular), city (it can refer to any city like Melbourne, Mumbai, Toronto, etc. but nothing in particular).
So, a common noun is a word that indicates a person, place, thing, etc. In general and a proper noun is a specific one of those.

3-Abstract Noun:
An abstract noun is a word for something that cannot be seen but is there. It has no physical existence. Generally, it refers to ideas, qualities, and conditions.
Example: Truth, lies, happiness, sorrow, time, friendship, humor, patriotism, etc.

4-Concrete Noun:
A concrete noun is the exact opposite of abstract noun. It refers to the things we see and have physical existence.
Example: Chair, table, bat, ball, water, money, sugar, etc.

5-Countable Noun:
The nouns that can be counted are called countable nouns. Countable nouns can take an article: a, an, the
Example: Chair, table, bat, ball, etc. (you can say 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs – so chairs are countable)
 
6-Non-countable Noun:
The nouns that cannot be counted are called non-countable nouns.
Example: Water, sugar, oil, salt, etc. (you cannot say “1 water, 2 water, 3 water” because water is not countable)
Abstract nouns and proper nouns are always non-countable nouns, but common nouns and concrete nouns can be both count and non-count nouns.

7-Collective Noun:
A collective noun is a word for a group of things, people, or animals, etc.
Example: family, team, jury, cattle, etc.

Collective nouns can be both plural and singular. However, Americans prefer to use collective nouns as singular, but both of the uses are correct in other parts of the world.

8-Compound Noun:
Sometimes two or three nouns appear together, or even with other parts of speech, and create idiomatic compound nouns. Idiomatic means that those nouns behave as a unit and, to a lesser or greater degree, amount to more than the sum of their parts.
Example: six-pack, five-year-old, and son-in-law, snowball, mailbox, etc.

Functions of Nouns
Nouns can be used as a subject, a direct object, and an indirect object of a verb; as an object of a preposition; and as an adverb or adjective in sentences. Nouns can also show possession.

Words between "- -" is the noun that has function;

Subject: The –company- is doing great. –Roses- are the flowers of love.
Direct object: I finally bought a new –mobile-.
Indirect object: Max gave –Carol- another chocolate.
Object of preposition: Roses are the flowers of –love-.
Adverb: The train leaves –today-.
Adjective: The –office- building faces the mall.
Possession: The -lion’s- cage is dangerous. My -brother’s- daughter is adorable.

 

  
  ''';

final grammer5 =
'''A pronoun is used in place of a specific noun mentioned earlier in a sentence so that you don’t have to keep saying/writing that particular noun.

Example:
Michael is a good boy. “He” gets up early in the morning. (Here, you don’t have to mention ‘Michael’ again)
The coach selected several key points. “He” wanted the team to memorize “them”. (‘He’ replaces ‘the coach’; ‘them’ replaces ‘several key points’)

The word or phrase that a pronoun replaces is called the antecedent of the pronoun. In the previous example, original noun ‘the coach’ is the antecedent and the pronoun ‘he’ is the referent because it refers back to the original noun. The antecedent and the pronoun/s must agree in terms of number and gender.

Types of Pronoun:

1-Subject Pronouns
2-Object Pronouns
3-Possessive Pronouns
4-Reflexive Pronouns
5-Intensive Pronouns
6-Relative Pronouns
7-Demonstrative Pronouns
8-Interrogative Pronouns
9-Subject Pronouns

1-Subject pronouns work as the subject of the verb in a sentence. A subject pronoun normally replaces the subject/object (a noun) of the previous sentence.

Example:
Mike can’t attend the party. “He” has gone to his grandparents.
Marta is a good storyteller. “She” told a ghost story that scared everyone.
Julie made some cakes. “They” look tasty. (Here, the subject pronoun replaced the object of the previous sentence)

2-Object Pronouns:
Object pronouns work as the object or indirect object in a sentence replacing the antecedent object. This form of the pronoun is also used after prepositions.

Example:
I’ll give “you” a present on your birthday. I have a great idea for you. (after preposition)
Tell “her” that you’ll take the job.
I have a gift for your boss. Give “it” to your boss. (Here, ‘it’works as an object)

3-Possessive Pronouns:
Possessive pronouns replace the nouns of the possessive adjectives: my, our, your, her, his, their. The possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, hers, his, its, theirs. The pronoun ‘who’ also has a possessive form, whose.

Example:
I thought my bag was lost, but the one Kesrick found was “mine”. (Here, ‘mine’ refers to ‘my bag’)
Their vacation will start next week. “Ours” is tomorrow. (Here, ‘ours’ refers to ‘our vacation’)
Those four suitcases are “ours”.
Is this “yours”?

You have to take either her car or “theirs”. “Hers” is better than theirs. (Here, ‘her’ is possessive adjective and ‘hers’ and ‘theirs’ are possessive pronouns which replaced ‘her car’ and ‘their car’)

4-Reflexive Pronouns:
Reflexive pronoun redirects a sentence or a clause back to the subject, which is also the direct object of that sentence. A reflexive pronoun comes when the subject performs its action upon itself. Here, ‘itself’ is a reflexive pronoun.
Example:
Since she is her own boss, she gave “herself” a raise. (Here, ‘herself’ is the direct object of the clause and the same person is the subject)
She allowed “herself” more time to get ready.
The computer restarts “itself” every night.
We told “ourselves” that we were so lucky to be alive.

5-Intensive Pronouns:

Intensive pronouns add emphasis/importance but do not act as the object in the sentence. They can appear right after the subject.

Example:
I will do it “myself”. (Here, ‘myself’ is not an object)
I “myself” saw the missing boat into the harbor.
We intend to do all the work “ourselves”.
You “yourselves” are responsible for this mess.

6-Relative Pronouns:
Relative pronouns introduce the relative clause. They are used to make clear what is being talked about in a sentence. They describe something more about the subject or the object.

The relative pronouns’ table :

Subject         ->   Which     That   Who
Object           ->   Which    That   Whom          
Possession    ->   Whose      –      Whose
Uncertainty   ->
1 Whichever ---- (for things)
---- (for both things and people)
Whoever/whomever/whosever ---- (for person)
            

The car “that” was stolen was the one they loved most.
A person “who” loves nature is a good person.
Our school, “which” was founded in 1995, is being renovated.
I will accept “whichever” party dress you buy me on Valentine's Day.
“Whoever” you are behind this great initiative, I want to thank you.

More Examples of Relative Pronoun

7-Demonstrative Pronouns:
Demonstrative pronouns normally indicate the closeness of or distance from the speaker, either literally or symbolically.  This, these, that, and those are the demonstrative pronouns. They also work as demonstrative adjectives when they modify a noun. However, demonstrative pronouns do not modify anything rather replace the nouns/noun phrases.
Sometimes neither, none and such are also used as demonstrative pronouns.

Example:
“That” is a long way to go. (demonstrative pronoun)
“This” is my car. (demonstrative pronoun)
Hand me “that” cricket bat. (demonstrative adjective)
“Neither” is permitted to enter the building.
“Such” are ways of life.
8-Interrogative Pronouns:
Interrogative pronouns produce questions. They are what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Who, whom, and whose refer to questions related to a person or animal; what refers to an idea, object, or event; and which can indicate either a person/s or a thing/s.

Example:
What was the name of your dog?
Which is your favorite movie?
Who works for you?
Whom do you prefer in this competition?
There’s a new bike on the lawn. Whose is it?

final grammer6 =
    '''An adjective describes or modifies noun/s and pronoun/s in a sentence. It normally indicates quality, size, shape, duration, feelings, contents, and more about a noun or pronoun.
Adjectives usually provide relevant information about the nouns/pronouns they modify/describe by answering the questions: What kind? How many? Which one? How much? Adjectives enrich your writing by adding precision and originality to it.

Example:
The team has a dangerous batsman. (What kind?)
I have ten candies in my pocket. (How many?)
I loved that red car. (Which one?)
I earn more money than he does. (How much?)

However, there are also many adjectives which do not fit into these questions. Adjectives are the most used parts of speech in sentences. There are several types of adjectives according to their uses.

Types of Adjectives

1-Descriptive Adjectives
2-Quantitative Adjectives
3-Proper Adjectives
4-Demonstrative Adjectives
5-Possessive Adjectives
6-Interrogative Adjectives
7-Indefinite Adjectives
8-Articles
9-Compound Adjectives

1-Descriptive Adjectives:
A descriptive adjective is a word which describes nouns and pronouns. Most of the adjectives belong in this type. These adjectives provide information and attribute to the nouns/pronouns they modify or describe. Descriptive adjectives are also called qualitative adjectives.

Participles are also included in this type of adjective when they modify a noun.

Examples:
I have a “fast” car. (The word ‘fast’ is describing an attribute of the car)
I am “hungry”. (The word ‘hungry’ is providing information about the subject)
The “hungry” cats are crying.
I saw a “flying” Eagle.

2-Quantitative Adjectives:
A quantitative adjective provides information about the quantity of the nouns/pronouns. This type belongs to the question category of ‘how much’ and ‘how many’.

Examples:
I have “20” bucks in my wallet. (How much)
They have “three” children. (How many)
You should have completed the “whole” task. (How much)

3-Proper Adjectives:
Proper adjectives are the adjective form of proper nouns. When proper nouns modify or describe other nouns/pronouns, they become proper adjectives. ‘Proper’ means ‘specific’ rather than ‘formal’ or ‘polite.’
A proper adjective allows us to summarize a concept in just one word. Instead of writing/saying ‘a food cooked in Chinese recipe’ you can write/say ‘Chinese food’.
Proper adjectives are usually capitalized as proper nouns are.

Example:
“American” cars are very strong.
“Chinese” people are hard workers.
I love “KFC” burgers.
“Marxist” philosophers despise capitalism.

 
4-Demonstrative Adjectives:
A demonstrative adjective directly refers to something or someone. Demonstrative adjectives include the words: this, that, these, those.
A demonstrative pronoun works alone and does not precede a noun, but a demonstrative adjective always comes before the word it modifies.

Examples:
“That” building is so gorgeously decorated. (‘That’ refers to a singular noun far from the speaker)
“This” car is mine. (‘This’ refers to a singular noun close to the speaker)
“These” cats are cute. (‘These’ refers to a plural noun close to the speaker)
“Those” flowers are heavenly. (‘Those’ refers to a plural noun far from the speaker)


5-Possessive Adjectives:
A possessive adjective indicates possession or ownership. It suggests the belongingness of something to someone/something.
Some of the most used possessive adjectives are my, his, her, our, their, your. 
All these adjectives always come before a noun. Unlike possessive pronouns, these words demand a noun after them.

Examples:
“My” car is parked outside.
“His” cat is very cute.
“Our” job is almost done.
“Her” books are interesting.

6-Interrogative Adjectives:
An interrogative adjective asks a question. An interrogative adjective must be followed by a noun or a pronoun. The interrogative adjectives are: which, what, whose. These words will not be considered as adjectives if a noun does not follow right after them. ‘Whose’ also belongs to the possessive adjective type.

Examples:
“Which” phone do you use?
“What” game do you want to play?
“Whose” car is this?

7-Indefinite Adjectives:
An indefinite adjective describes or modifies a noun unspecifically. They provide indefinite/unspecific information about the noun. The common indefinite adjectives are few, many, much, most, all, any, each, every, either, nobody, several, some, etc.  

Examples:
I gave “some” candy to her.
I want “a few” moments alone.
“Several” writers wrote about the recent incidents.
“Each” student will have to submit homework tomorrow.

8-Articles
Articles also modify the nouns. So, articles are also adjectives. Articles determine the specification of nouns. ‘A’ and ‘an’ are used to refer to an unspecific noun, and ‘the’ is used to refer to a specific noun.  

Examples:
“A” cat is always afraid of water. (Here, the noun ‘cat’ refers to any cat, not specific.)
“The” cat is afraid of me. (This cat is a specific cat.)
“An” electronic product should always be handled with care.

9-Compound Adjectives:
When compound nouns/combined words modify other nouns, they become a compound adjective. This type of adjective usually combines more than one word into a single lexical unit and modifies a noun. They are often separated by a hyphen or joined together by a quotation mark.  

Example:
I have a “broken-down” sofa.
I saw a “six-foot-long” snake.
He gave me an “I’m gonna kill you now” look.
The Degree of Adjectives:

There are three degrees of adjectives: Positive, comparative, superlative.
These degrees are applicable only for the descriptive adjectives.

Examples:
Positive degree: He is a “good” boy.
Comparative degree: He is “better” than any other boy.
Superlative: He is the “best” boy."
''';

final grammer7='''A verb is a word or a combination of words that indicates action or a state of being or condition. A verb is the part of a sentence that tells us what the subject performs. Verbs are the hearts of English sentences.

Examples:
Jacob “walks” in the morning. (A usual action)
Mike “is going” to school. (A condition of action)
Albert “does not like” to walk. (A negative action)
Anna “is” a good girl. (A state of being)

Verbs are related to a lot of other factors like the subject, person, number, tense, mood, voice, etc.
Basic Forms of Verbs
There are six basic forms of verbs. These forms are as follows:

Base form: Children “play” in the field.
Infinitive: Tell them not “to play”
Past tense: They “played” football yesterday.
Past participle: I have “eaten” a burger.
Present participle: I saw them “playing” with him today.
Gerund: “Swimming” is the best exercise.

  

Different Types of Verbs
1-Finite Verbs
2-Non-finite Verbs
3-Action Verbs
4-Linking Verb
5-Auxiliary Verbs
6-Modal Verbs



1-Finite Verbs:
Finite verbs are the actual verbs which are called the roots of sentences. It is a form of a verb that is performed by or refers to a subject and uses one of the twelve forms of tense and changes according to the number/person of the subject.

Example:
Alex “went” to school. (Subject – Alex – performed the action in the past. This information is evident only by the verb ‘went’.)
Robert “plays” hockey.
He “is playing” for Australia.
He “is” one of the best players. (Here, the verb ‘is’ directly refers to the subject itself.)

2-Non-finite Verbs:
Non-finite Verbs are not actual verbs. They do not work as verbs in the sentence rather they work as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Non-finite verbs do not change according to the number/person of the subject because these verbs, also called verbals, do not have any direct relation to the subject. Sometimes they become the subject themselves.

The forms of non-finite verbs are – infinitive, gerund, and participle (participles become finite verbs when they take auxiliary verbs.)

Example:
Alex went abroad “to play” (Infinitives)
“Playing” cricket is his only job. (Present participle)
I have a “broken” bat. (Past participle)
“Walking” is a good habit. (Gerund)

3-Action Verbs:
Action verbs indicate what the subject of a sentence performs. Action verbs can make the listener/reader feel emotions, see scenes more vividly and accurately.
Action verbs can be transitive or intransitive.
Transitive verbs must have a direct object. A transitive verb demands something/someone to be acted upon.

Example:
I “painted” the car. (The verb ‘paint’ demands an object to be painted)
She “is reading” the newspaper. (The verb ‘read’ asks the question “what is she reading?” – the answer is the object)

Intransitive verbs do not act upon anything. They may be followed by an adjective, adverb, preposition, or another part of speech.

Example
She “smiled”. (The verb ‘smile’ cannot have any object since the action of ‘smiling’ does not fall upon anything/anyone)
I “wake” up at 6 AM. (No object is needed for this verb)

Note: {Subject + Intransitive verb} is sufficient to make a complete sentence but {Subject + Transitive verb} is not sufficient because transitive verbs demand a direct object.

4-Linking Verb:

A linking verb adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it connects the subject and the complement — that is, the words that follow the linking verb. It creates a link between them instead of showing action.
Often, what is on each side of a linking verb is equivalent; the complement redefines or restates the subject.
Generally, linking verbs are called ‘be’ verbs which are - am, is, are, was, were. However, there are some other verbs which can work as linking verbs. Those verbs are:
Act, feel, remain, appear, become, seem, smell, sound, grow, look, prove, stay, taste, turn.

Some verbs in this list can also be action verbs. To figure out if they are linking verbs, you should try replacing them with forms of the be verbs. If the changed sentence makes sense, that verb is a linking verb.

Example:
She “appears” ready for the game. (She “is” ready for the game.)
The food “seemed” delicious. (The food “was” delicious.)
You “look” happy. (You “are” happy.)
Auxiliary Verbs:

5-Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs. An auxiliary verb extends the main verb by helping to show time, tense, and possibility. The auxiliary verbs are – be verbs, have, and do.
They are used in the continuous (progressive) and perfect tenses.
Linking verbs work as main verbs in the sentence, but auxiliary verbs help main verbs.
Do is an auxiliary verb that is used to ask questions, to express negation, to provide emphasis, and more.

Example:
Alex “is” going to school.
They “are” walking in the park.
I “have” seen a movie.
“Do” you drink tea?
“Don’t” waste your time.
Please, “do” submit your assignments.


6-Modal Verbs:
A modal verb is a kind of an auxiliary verb. It assists the main verb to indicate possibility, potentiality, ability, permission, expectation, and obligation.
The modal verbs are can, could, must, may, might, ought to, shall, should, will, would.

 Example:
I “may” want to talk to you again.
They “must” play their best game to win.
She “should” call him.
I “will” go there
''';

final grammer8='''An adverb is a word/a set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. It tells when, where, and how an action is performed or indicates the quality or degree of the action.
Many adverbs end in -ly but some words which end in -ly (such as friendly) are not adverbs. Many words can be both adverbs and adjectives according to their activity in the sentence.

Example:
Robin is “always” hungry for success.
I love her “very much”.
He is running “fast”.
Alex works “hard”.
He wrote that “willingly”.

Adverb Clauses and Adverb Phrases are clauses and phrases that modify the verbs, adjectives or other adverbs in the sentence.

Example:
He ran toward the bus “until he was tired”. (Adverb Clause)
He came “carrying his box with two hands”. (Adverb Phrase)
We were panicked “without any reason”. (Adverb Phrase)


Types of Adverbs:
1-Conjunctive Adverbs
2-Sentence Adverbs
3-Adverbs of Time/Frequency (When?)
4-Adverbs of Place/Direction (Where?)
5-Adverbs of Degree (How Much?)
6-Adverbs of Manner (How?)


1-Conjunctive Adverbs:
A conjunctive adverb connects phrases or independent clauses. It provides transitions between ideas and shows relationships.
Conjunctive adverbs are also called connectors.

Example:
It rained last night. “Nonetheless”, the final match has not been canceled.
We are still confused, “however”, if the umpires will come.
Last season there was a great drought; “consequently”, we could not grow crops.

2-Sentence Adverbs:
A sentence adverb starts the sentence and modifies the whole sentence.

Example:
“Hopefully”, we will win the match.
“Apparently”, the sky is getting cloudy.
“Certainly”, I did not think of coming here.

3-Adverbs of Time/Frequency (When?)
Adverbs of time/frequency indicate time or frequency of the action in the sentence. They answer the question ‘when/how frequently is the action performed?’.
Always, never, often, eventually, now, frequently, occasionally, once, forever, seldom, before, Sunday, Monday, 10 AM, 12 PM, etc. are common adverbs of time/frequency.

Example:
I went to school “a little late” “yesterday”.
He “always” gets a good result.
I will leave “Monday”.
He smokes “occasionally”.

4-Adverbs of Place/Direction (Where?)
Adverbs of place/direction that indicate place/direction of the action in the sentence. They answer the question ‘ where is the action performed?’.
Across, over, under, in, out, through, backward, there, around, here, sideways, upstairs, in the park, in the field, in that place, etc. are some common adverbs of place/direction.

Example:
I went “through the jungle”.
He plays “in the field”.
Alex is going “to school”.
He is staying at “my home”.

5-Adverbs of Degree (How Much?)
Adverbs that express the importance/degree/level of the action in the sentence are called adverbs of degree. They answer the question ‘how much is the action performed?’.
Completely, nearly, entirely, less, mildly, most, thoroughly, somewhat, excessively, much, etc. are common adverbs of degree.

Example:
She “completely” forgot about her anniversary.
I read the newspaper “thoroughly”.
I am “so” excited about the new job.
Robin “hardly” studies


6-Adverbs of Manner (How?)
Adverbs that express the manner/approach/process of the action in the sentence are called adverbs of manner. They answer the question ‘how is the action performed?’.
Beautifully, equally, thankfully, carefully, handily, quickly, coldly, hotly, resentfully, earnestly, nicely, tirelessly, etc. are common adverbs of manner. These adverbs usually end in ly.

Example:
Let's divide the prizes “equally”.
Please, handle the camera “carefully”.
Mike is walking “slowly”.
He is running “fast."
''';

final grammer9='''A preposition is a word that indicates the relationship between a noun and the other words of a sentence. They explain relationships of sequence, space, and logic between the object of the sentence and the rest of the sentence. They help us understand order, time connections, and positions.

Example:
I am going “to” Canada.
Alex threw a stone “into” the pond.
The present is “inside” the box.
They have gone “out of” the town.

There are a few interesting linguistic facts about preposition.
First, they are a closed class of words which means no new preposition gets added to the language. We use a fixed set of prepositions.
Second, prepositions do not have any other form. They cannot be plural, possessive, inflection, or anything else.
Third, most of the prepositions have many different contextual and natural uses. So, it is easy to be confused about preposition.
Fourth, sometimes a preposition works as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.

Prepositions can be of one, two, three, or even more words. Prepositions with two or more words are called phrasal prepositions.

There are some commonly used phrasal prepositions:
because of, in case of, instead of, by way of, on behalf of, on account of, in care of, in spite of, on the side of, etc.

 

Types of Preposition
Most of the prepositions have many uses. There are some prepositions which are common in every type of preposition as they function in a versatile way.

1-Prepositions of Time
2-Prepositions of Place and Direction
3-Prepositions of Agents or Things
4-Phrasal Prepositions

1-Prepositions of Time:
Prepositions of time show the relationship of time between the nouns to the other parts of a sentence.
On, at, in, from, to, for, since, ago, before, till/until, by, etc. are the most common preposition of time.

Example:
He started working “at 10 AM”.
The company called meeting “on 25 October”.
There is a holiday “in December”.
He has been ill “since Monday”.

2-Prepositions of Place and Direction:

Prepositions of place show the relationship of place between the nouns to the other parts of a sentence.
On, at, in, by, from, to, towards, up, down, across, between, among, through, in front of, behind, above, over, under, below, etc. are the most common prepositions of place/direction.

Example:
He is “at home”.
He came “from England”.
The police broke “into the house”.
I live “across the river”.


3-Prepositions of Agents or Things:
Prepositions of agents or things indicate a casual relationship between nouns and other parts of the sentence.
Of, for, by, with, about, etc. are the most used and common prepositions of agents or things.

Example:
This article is “about smartphones”.
Most “of the guests” have already left.
I will always be here “for you”.
He is playing with his brothers”.

4-Phrasal Prepositions:
A phrasal preposition is not a prepositional phrase, but they are a combination of two or more words which functions as a preposition.
Along with, apart from, because of, by means of, according to, in front of, contrary to, in spite of, on account of, in reference to, in addition to, in regard to, instead of, on top of, out of, with regard to, etc. are the most common phrasal prepositions.

Example:
They “along with” their children went to Atlanta.
“According to” the new rules, you are not right.
“In spite of” being a good player, he was not selected.
I’m going “out of” the city.

final grammer10='''Conjunctions are used to join clauses, phrases, and words together for constructing sentences. Conjunctions make a link between/among words or groups of words to other parts of the sentence and show a relationship between/among them.

Example:
Alex “and” Robin are playing together.
Alex plays well, “but” Robin plays better than him.
I play cricket, “and” Robin plays football.
“When” he was sick, I went to see him.

 

Types of Conjunctions
1-Coordinating Conjunctions
2-Correlative Conjunctions
3-Subordinating Conjunctions


1-Coordinating Conjunctions:
The job of a coordinating conjunction is to join two words, phrases, or independent clauses, which are parallel in structure. There are seven coordinating conjunctions which are by far the most common conjunctions:  and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet.

Example:
We went to the stadium “and” enjoyed the cricket match.
Do you want an ice cream “or” chocolate?
Go away “and” never come back.

2-Correlative Conjunctions:
A correlative conjunction uses a set of words in a parallel sentence structure to show a contrast or to compare the equal parts of a sentence. The words of correlative conjunctions have a special connection between them.
The correlative conjunctions are not only - but also, either- or, neither - nor, both - and, not - but, whether - or.

Example:
“Neither” Alex “nor” Robin can play baseball.
I want “both” ice cream “and” chocolate
He ate “not only” the ice cream “but also” the chocolate.


3-Subordinating Conjunctions:
A subordinating conjunction joins elements of an unparallel sentence structure. These elements are usually a dependent clause and an independent clause.
Most commonly used subordinating conjunctions are:
After, how, than, when, although, if, that, where, as, in order that, though, which, as much as, inasmuch as, unless, while, because, provided, until, who/whom, before, since, what, whoever/whomever.

Example:
“Before” we left home, I had had my breakfast.
“Provided” they come, we can start class Tuesday.
“When” he was washing my car, I went to the store.
“Even though” the weather was horrible, they still went outside.
''';

final grammer11= '''An interjection is a kind of exclamation inserted into regular speech. Actually, it is a brief and abrupt pause in speech for expressing emotions.

Interjections are unique and have some interesting features:

Interjections don’t have a grammatical function in the sentence construction.
They usually cannot be modified or inflected.
They do not have to have a relation to the other parts of the sentence.
They are highly context-sensitive.

In spoken language, interjections are the words we instantly use to show our reaction to something which influences our emotion. They are the initial reaction and sometimes do not even make sense. However, for formal speech or writing, using interjections is not appropriate.

Interjections mainly have four roles:

Rule 1: Interjections express a sudden mood, emotions, and feeling with emphasis. There are also many taboo words that are usually used in everyday conversation but not in formal aspects. These words fall into the category of interjections.

Example:

“Wow!” That’s an amazing scene.
“Aw”, I did not want him to come.
“What?” You never told me that!

Rule 2: Some interjections interrupt a conversation or a thought or hold someone’s attention for a moment. These are just sounds, not words because these sounds do not make any sense.

Example:
Your, “um”, shirt has a stain on the back.
I want to, “uh”, ask you out on a date.

Rule 3: Some interjections express only yes or no.

Example:
“Yes!” I will most definitely do it.
“Nah”, we are not going.

Rule 4: Some interjections are used to get someone’s attention.

Example:
“Yo”, Alex! Get in the car!
“Hey!” Will you give me that ball?
“Yoo-hoo!” Is there anyone?

 
''';

final grammer12= '''Tenses demonstrate the time of an action in a sentence usually performed by or centered around the subject of the sentence. The actions are called verbs. Verbs change according to tenses and other issues. As verbs are the most important elements of English sentences, tenses also carry paramount importance in English grammar.

Tenses are mainly categorized into three types.

1. Present Tense
2. Past Tense
3. Future Tense
 
1-Present Tense

Each of the types of tenses has four different forms.

1a-Present Indefinite Tense
1b-Present Progressive (Continuous) Tense
1c-Present Perfect Tense
1-dPresent Perfect Progressive (Continuous)

1a-Present Indefinite Tense

The present indefinite tense, also known as simple present tense, denotes a stative or habitual or eternally true action.

Generally simple present tense is used to indicate an action which happens – always, regularly, every day, daily, normally, generally, usually, occasionally, sometimes, often, rarely, frequently, nowadays, naturally, seldom, constantly, never, every a week, every year, once a year, on a week, at times, at present, now and then, or all the time.

Structure:
Subject (third person singular number) + verb in simple present form + s/es + . . . . .
Subject (all other kinds) + verb in simple present form + . . . . .

Note: When ‘be’ verbs work as the main verb in a sentence, they are different from the above structures.


Examples:
I know Billy Bob.
He understands it.
They love swinging in the park.
Some people do not believe in God.
I usually wake up at 6.00 AM.
He plays cricket, but his brother plays football.
Earth is bigger than Mercury.
The heat of the sun is the least in the polar.



1b-Present Progressive (Continuous) Tense
The present progressive is used to indicate the ongoing time (now). However, the stative verbs do not usually take the form of present progressive even though they refer to the present time.

Now, continually, perpetually, at this moment, at the moment, right now, This season, this year, forever, etc. are usually the signs of a verb to take present progressive tense. However, these signs are not necessary all the time for a verb to present progressive tense.

Structure:

Subject + am/is/are + verb + ing + . . . . . . . . .

Example:
I am going to the college field.
He is coming here for some tips.
They are making a basketball ground.
Why are you working in that horrible place?
Four teams are playing at this moment.

This structure is also used to demonstrate future time.

Example:
Alex is leaving for Portugal tomorrow.
I am going to complete my task tomorrow.
Our bus is leaving at 6.00 PM.
They are flying to Australia next month.

1c-Present Perfect Tense

The present perfect tense is used when one intends to indicate:
an action that occurred at a time which is indefinite and has its effect on the subject
or an action that occurred many times and has the possibility to occur in the present/future
or an action that began in the past and still going on in the present.

Structure:
Subject + have/has + verb in the past participle form + . . . . . . .

Example:
Alex has read the book through. (No time is indicated)
I have read this poem many times. (Not habitual but occurred many times in the past)
He has lived in this apartment for 15 years. (Still going on)

Just, already, yet, just now, ever, lately, recently, etc. are some of the signs for present perfect tense.

Note: Already comes between have/has and the past participle; yet appears with a negative form at the end of the sentence.

Example:  
Alex has already reached there.
Alex has not reached yet.
I have already cleaned the house.
I have not cleaned the house yet.

1d-Present Perfect Progressive (Continuous)
It is the least used form of present tense. Present perfect progressive is used to indicate an action that began in the past and is still occurring in the present. Both present perfect and present perfect continuous can be used to indicate this type of action.

Structure:

Subject + have/has + been + [verb + ing] + . . . . . .

Example:
Alex has been reading for 3 years.
I have been sleeping since 10.00 AM
Robert has been working in that shop for 6 years.
We have been living together for four years.

Structure:
Subject + verb in the past form + . . . . . + adverb of time + . . . . .

Note: Adverb of time can also be at the beginning of the sentence. Other sentences can also refer to that adverb and can use simple past tense.

Example:

Alex went to Mexico last year.
I ate a mango a few minutes ago.
He had an exam yesterday.

final grammer16='''Phrase and clause are the most important elements of English grammar. Phrase and clause cover everything a sentence has. Clauses are the center of sentences and phrases strengthen the sentences to become meaningful. If the clauses are the pillars of a building, the phrases are the bricks. A phrase usually is always present within a clause, but a phrase cannot have a clause in it.

The basic difference between a clause and a phrase is that a clause must have a finite verb and a phrase must not.

A phrase, therefore, is a group of words which has no finite verb in it and acts to complete the sentence for making it meaningful.

“A phrase is a small group of words that form a meaningful unit within a clause.”
-Oxford Dictionary
“In linguistic analysis, a phrase is a group of words (or possibly a single word) that functions as a constituent in the syntax of a sentence, a single unit within agrammatical hierarchy.”
 
Types of Phrases

The phrases are generally of six types.

1-Noun Phrase
2-Adjective Phrase
3-Adverbial Phrase
4-Prepositional Phrase
5-Conjunctional Phrase
6-Interjectional Phrase


1-Noun Phrase
A noun phrase is usually assembled centering a single noun and works as a subject, an object or a complement in the sentence.

Example:
I like “to swing the bat” hard when I am at the crease. (An object)
“Reading novels” is a good habit. (A subject)
“The probability of happening that match” is not much. (A subject)
We are sorry for her “departure”.

2-Adjective Phrase
An adjective phrase is comprised of an adjective and works as a single adjective in the sentence.

Example:
Alex is a “well-behaved” man.
He is a man “of friendly natüre”.
Julie is a woman “of gorgeous style”.
She leads a “very interesting” life.
“A lot of” people do not sleep at night.

3-Adverbial Phrase
An adverbial phrase modifies the verb or the adjective and works as an adverb in the sentence.

Example:
The horse runs “at a good speed”.
I was “in a hurry then”.
I ran “as fast as possible”.
He works “very slowly”.

4-Prepositional Phrase
A prepositional phrase always begins with a preposition and connects nouns.

Example:
He sacrificed his life “for the sake of” his country.
“In the end”, we all have to die.
He is “on the way”.
“By working aimlessly”, you will not get success.
“In spite of” working hard, he was insulted by his boss.

Note: Prepositional phrases include all other types of phrases.

5-Conjunctional Phrase
A conjunctional phrase works as a conjunction in the sentence.

Example:
“As soon as” you got in, he went out.
We have to work hard “so that” we can win the next match.
I will attend the ceremony “provided that” you come.
John started working early “in order that” he could finish early.

6-Interjectional Phrase
Interjections that have more than one words are called the interjectional phrases.
Example:
What a pity! He is dead.
What a pleasure! I won the first prize.
Oh please! Don’t say that again.
''';

final grammer17='''A clause is comprised of a group of words which includes a subject and a finite verb. A clause contains only one subject and one verb. The subject of a clause can be mentioned or hidden, but the verb must be apparent and distinguishable.

Example:
I graduated last year. (One clause sentence)
When I came here, I saw him. (Two clause sentence)
When I came here, I saw him, and he greeted me. (Three clause sentence)

Types of Clause
Clauses are mainly of two types:

1-Independent Clause
2-Dependent Clause

1-Independent Clause
An independent clause functions on its own to make a meaningful sentence and looks much like a regular sentence.
In a sentence two independent clauses can be connected by the coordinators: and, but, so, or, nor, for*, yet*.

Example:
He is a wise man.
I like him.
Can you do it?
Do it please. (Subject you is hidden)
I read the whole story.
I want to buy a phone, but I don’t have enough money. (Two independent clauses)
He went to London and visited the Lords. (Subject of the second clause is ‘he,' so “he visited the Lords” is an independent clause.)
Alex smiles whenever he sees her. (One independent clause)

2-Dependent Clause
A dependent clause cannot function on its own because it leaves an idea or thought unfinished. It is also called subordinate clause. Dependent clauses help the independent clauses complete the sentence. A dependent clause alone cannot form a complete sentence.
The subordinators do the work of connecting the dependent clause to another clause to complete the sentence. In each of the dependent clause, the first word is a subordinator. Subordinators include relative pronouns, subordinating conjunctions, and noun clause markers.

Example:
When I was dating Daina, I had an accident.
I know the man who stole the watch.
He bought a car which was too expensive.
I know that he cannot do it.
He does not know where he was born.
If you don’t eat, I won’t go.
He is a very talented player though he is out of form

final grammer18='''Normally conditional sentences are called conditionals. These sentences usually contain the conjunction IF. Sometimes  they are called 'if clauses'.

Types of Conditionals

There are mainly two types of conditionals:

1-The Real Conditionals and
2-The Unreal Conditionals

1-The real conditionals
The real conditionals express factual or habitual conditions which have the possibility to occur in the future or generally occur in the present.

Example:
I’ll go if you give me the ball.
If I feel better, I’ll certainly play.
If you do well in the exams, I’ll buy you a gift.
Structures of the Real Conditionals:

For Future Conditions
If + subject + simple present tense + subject + will/can/may/must + verb in base form. . .
Subject + will/can/may/must + verb in base form. . . + if + subject + simple present tense
Example:

If I have the money, I will buy a new phone.
I can make you cry if you keep doing that.
If he goes there, he may get robbed.
If you go outside, you must wear heavy clothes.

 

For Habitual Conditions
If + subject + simple present tense + subject + simple present tense. . .
Subject + simple present tense + if + subject + simple present tense. .
Example:

If I have the money, I always buy the necessary things.
If Alex gets a break, he usually calls me.
He works hard if the payment is good.

 

For Commands
If + subject + simple present tense + command form (simple present) . . . . .
Command form (simple present). . . . .  + if + subject + simple present tense. 
Example:

If you have the money, use it wisely.
Please call me if you get a chance.

2-The unreal conditionals
The unreal conditionals express hypothetical conditions which have no possibility to occur in the past, present or future but describe what could/might have occurred supposedly.

Example:
If I were rich, I would travel my whole life.
If I had a car, I could go anywhere.
If we had not missed the train, we would have reached the city.
Structures of Unreal Conditionals:
For Present/Future Conditions
If + subject + simple past tense + subject + would/could/might + verb in base form. . .
subject + would/could/might + verb in base form + if + subject + simple past tense
Example:

If I had the money, I would buy a new phone.
If I were the president, I would not support war policies.
If he were not ill, he could come with us.
If I could play tomorrow, I would definitely win the match.

 

For Past Conditions
If + subject + past perfect tense + subject + would/could/might + have+ verb in past particple form
Subject + would/could/might + have + verb in past participle form + if + subject + simple past tense
Example:

If I had played well, we would have won the match.
I could have caught you if you had been a little closer.
If he had written well, I could have given him a better mark.

Note: There is another structure of unreal conditional which does not use the conjunction if. Had replaces if and creates a conditional sentence.

Had + subject + verb in past participle + subject + would/could/might + have + verb in past particple
Example:

Had I reached earlier, I could have caught the train.
Had she found the watch, she would have told me.

final grammer19='''There is no doubt that articles are adjectives since they modify the nouns after them. But articles have some special significance as determiners.  Articles determine the standard of nouns.

There are two types of articles:

Definite Article -  the
The makes the noun something particular and definite.

Example:

Give me the ball.
(Here, the speaker is telling someone to give him/her a particular ball about which the speaker and the listener both are aware. There is no possibility of the ball to be anything else rather than the speaker and the listener idea of that particular ball.)

Indefinite Article -  a & an
A & an - make the noun something general and indefinite.

Example:

Give me a ball.
(Here, the speaker is telling someone to give him/her a random ball about which the listener is not particularly aware of, and s/he might ask ‘which/what kind of ball you want?’.)

Give me an egg. (It can be any kind of egg – the possibility is open.)''';
